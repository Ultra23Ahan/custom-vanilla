# Hello!

This is a custom vanilla framework that I made. It uses the following tools:

Babel \
Terser \
stylelint \
autoprefixer \
postcss \
cssnano \
shx \
purgecss \
live-server


This framework was made for people who want to use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS but want some extra features like autoprefixing so CSS works on multiple browsers, linting and purging unused css, and minification of their CSS and JS code. 


# Usage

To build \
`pnpm run build` (pnpm and yarn are also supported)

To start a live server(using build folder): \
`pnpm run start`

To start a dev server: \
`pnpm run dev`
