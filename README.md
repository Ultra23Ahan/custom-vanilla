# Hello!

This is a custom vanilla framework that I made. It uses the following tools:

Babel \
Terser \
stylelint \
autoprefixer \
postcss \
cssnano \
shx \
purgecss \
live-server


This framework was made for people who want to use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS but want some extra features like autoprefixing so CSS works on multiple browsers, linting and purging unused css, and minification of their CSS and JS code. 

### Supported package managers:
pnpm, yarn, and npm are suported

# Usage

To scaffold a new project:\
run `pnpx @ultra23ahan/custom-vanilla my-app` - creates a new folder 'my-app'

To build: \
`pnpm run build` (npm and yarn are also supported)

To start a live server(using build folder): \
`pnpm run start`

To start a dev server: \
`pnpm run dev`
